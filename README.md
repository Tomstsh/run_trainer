# run_trainer

A small project to train in using the GPT API and a message broker (RabbitMQ probably) 

Containerized dev environment where the back and front end both run from the same container. 
I realise a better solution would probably be to have the back and front ends run from seperate containers,
but I'd done it that way before so I wanted to see what I could learn from developing this way instead.
